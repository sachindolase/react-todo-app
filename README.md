# QuadB Tech Frontend Developement(React.js) Assessment

# Task Title: Build a Simple React To-Do Application

# Objective: 
Develop a basic To-Do application using ReactJS that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. This application should showcase your understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, hooks, and state management using Redux.

# Requirements:

1) Frontend Development:
- Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
- Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
- Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).

2) React Components:
- Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- The application should have at least two components:    
- TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
- TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.

3) State Management:  
- Use Redux to manage the application's state. This includes storing the tasks and updating the state when adding or removing tasks.
- Implement actions and reducers to handle the state logic.


4) Functionality:
- Add Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.


5) Edit Task: Each task should have an edit button that, when clicked, task popup opens from the list.

6) Bonus (Optional):
- Add the capability to mark tasks as completed without deleting them. This could involve toggling the task's state and styling.
- Implement persistent storage (e.g., saving tasks to local storage) so that tasks are not lost on page reload.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
